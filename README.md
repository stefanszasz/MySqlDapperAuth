# MySqlDapperAuth POC
This is a simple Web Api 2.2 Authentication POC using MySql and Dapper

## Start
- Make sure you have access to a MySql server.
- Run the script found in the 'database' on your MySql database
- In src\Web.config change the connection string to point to your database
- Open the solution in VS and access the 'Login' upper menu to login/register or try to access the 'Values' that required authentication
